    <p>A supermarket is a self-service shop offering a wide variety of food, beverages and household products, organized into sections. This kind of store is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market. In everyday U.S. usage, however, "grocery store" is often used to mean "supermarket".</p>

        <p>These practices were by nature slow, had high labor intensity, and were quite expensive. The number of customers who could be attended to at one time was limited by the number of staff employed in the store. Shopping for groceries often also involved trips to multiple specialty shops, such as a greengrocer, butcher, bakery, fishmonger and dry goods store, in addition to a general store. Milk and other items of short shelf life were delivered by a milkman.</p>

        <p>While contemporary festivals are often represented as flourishing grounds for extraordinary experiences,[8] they increasingly serve as a way to create cultural identity, lifestyle, community, belonging and self-actualisation.[9] Furthermore, festivals are a manifestation for creating escapism[10] and a seasonal cultural economy to experience ritually and collectively.[11]</p>
